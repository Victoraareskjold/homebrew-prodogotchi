brew install prodogotchi

Prodogotchi is my first real project written in Python. Itâ€™s a command-line tool designed to help developers manage their tasks with a bit more fun and personality, inspired by the charm of Tamagotchi. It lets you create, track, and complete tasks with time estimates and visual feedback.
